Foundational:

DONE - Support attachments (images with recipes in them)
DONE - Support URLs (links to recipe sites)
DONE - Respect text/token limits in conversation history

- Also check and decide what to do about image content in history
  - Part of the problem is that the UI form will re-upload currently

Optimizations / UX:

- For desktop UX maybe second-pane the relevant recipe up on the side of the chat history?
- Handle "no relevant recipes" well
- Show tool use - recipe addition/update (maybe with recipe contents)
- Handle speech-to-text input
- Handle text-to-speech output
- Optimize redundant recipes in context window
- Better Mobile UX
- Improve URL extraction (it's pretty janky)

- Recipe archival?

Technical

- TPM rate limits - not sure what I can do about it but 3k/minute for current 4o is pretty limiting
- async io cleanup
- Enforce type hints (and apply them more completely)
- Get black working
- Get prettier working
