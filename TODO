Foundational:

DONE - Support attachments (images with recipes in them)
DONE - Support URLs (links to recipe sites)

- Respect text/token limits in conversation history

Optimizations / UX:

- Handle "no relevant recipes" well
- Show tool use - recipe addition/update (maybe with recipe contents)
- Handle speech-to-text input
- Handle text-to-speech output
- Optimize redundant recipes in context window
- Better Mobile UX
- Improve URL extraction (it's pretty janky)

Technical

- async cleanup
- Enforce type hints (and apply them more completely)
- Get black working
